# Hydro-Galaxy-Sim-Processor
Loads in galaxy simulations and does the following:
- Merge their parts into a single file (Done)
- Identify where the halo is given FoF/Group input. If FoF information is not known, semi-automated galaxy identification is possible. (Almost Done)
- Cut a box around the galaxy given a defined length
- Post-processing for removing items
- Use GalPy to create a semi-analytical model for conducting particle evolution
